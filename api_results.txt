Output: The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, actually consists of two related theories: special relativity and general relativity.

**Special Relativity (1905):**
- Special relativity deals with the physics of objects that are moving at constant speeds, especially those speeds close to the speed of light.
- The key idea is that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, regardless of their relative speed, and that the speed of light in a vacuum is always the same, no matter how fast someone is moving.
- This leads to some surprising outcomes:
  - **Time Dilation:** Time moves slower for objects moving at high speeds compared to those at rest. This means if you could travel near the speed of light, you would age more slowly compared to your friends on Earth.
  - **Length Contraction:** Objects moving at high speeds will appear shorter in the direction of motion to a stationary observer.
  - **Mass-Energy Equivalence:** Expressed by the famous equation \(E=mc^2\), meaning mass and energy can be converted into each other.

**General Relativity (1915):**
- General relativity extends the ideas of special relativity to include acceleration and gravity.
- The central concept is that gravity is not just a force between two masses but a curvature of space and time (spacetime) caused by mass and energy.
- Massive objects like planets and stars warp the spacetime around them, and this curvature affects how objects move.
- For example, the Earth orbits the Sun not because of an invisible force acting at a distance, but because it is moving along a path in the curved spacetime created by the Sun's mass.

In simple terms, special relativity changes our understanding of time and space when things are moving fast, while general relativity gives us a new way to think about gravity by explaining it as the bending of spacetime around massive objects.
