Output: OpenAI error: 

You tried to access openai.ChatCompletion, but this is no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0 - see the README at https://github.com/openai/openai-python for the API.

You can run `openai migrate` to automatically upgrade your codebase to use the 1.0.0 interface. 

Alternatively, you can pin your installation to the old version, e.g. `pip install openai==0.28`

A detailed migration guide is available here: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742

Output: The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, is a fundamental concept in modern physics that describes the nature of space, time, and gravity. There are two parts to the theory: special relativity and general relativity.

Special Relativity:
- The laws of physics are the same for all observers moving at constant speeds relative to each other.
- The speed of light is constant and independent of the motion of the source or the observer.
- As an object approaches the speed of light, time slows down for that object (time dilation), and its length contracts (length contraction).
- Mass and energy are equivalent, as described by the famous equation E=mcÂ², where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light.

General Relativity:
- Gravity is not a force, but rather a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy.
- Massive objects curve spacetime, and this curvature tells matter (and light) how to move.
- The curvature of spacetime can lead to phenomena such as the bending of light, the slowing of time near massive objects (gravitational time dilation), and the existence of black holes.

In summary, the theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity, showing that they are interconnected and can be affected by motion and the presence of mass and energy.
